SmartQuizApp is an engaging educational Android application designed to test and expand users' knowledge of current Atlanta Hip Hop music through an interactive quiz experience. The app presents a series of true/false (Yes/No) questions related to popular artists, albums, lyrics, collaborations, and current trends in the Atlanta hip hop scene. Users answer one question at a time, receiving instant feedback—either “Correct” or “Incorrect”—to help reinforce their understanding and keep the quiz experience lively and informative.

The app's user interface is built using essential Android components: TextView displays each question and the result response, while Button elements allow users to interact with the quiz via “Yes”, “No”, “Next”, “Show Corrections”, and “Exit” options. A vertically stacked LinearLayout ensures smooth screen flow. Once all questions have been answered, the “Show Corrections” button reveals a summary with the user’s score and any incorrect answers along with their correct responses. Only after this review phase does the “Exit” button appear, providing a natural conclusion to the session. With its responsive design, real-time feedback, and cultural relevance, SmartQuizApp makes learning about the evolving world of Atlanta hip hop music both fun and educational—perfect for fans, students, and enthusiasts who want to stay current on the genre.
