SmartQuizApp is an educational Android application designed to help users improve their knowledge of American History through an interactive true/false (Yes/No) quiz format. The app presents a series of questions one at a time, allowing users to select “Yes” or “No” as their answer. Immediate feedback is provided, informing the user whether their answer is correct or incorrect, which reinforces learning in real-time. At the end of the quiz, users can view a summary of corrections by tapping the “Show Corrections” button, which reveals the correct answers for any mistakes made during the quiz.

The user interface is built using Android components like TextView for displaying questions and results, and Button elements for user interaction (Yes, No, Show Corrections, and Exit). The app is structured using a LinearLayout to ensure a clean, vertical flow of content. The Exit button, which becomes visible only after the corrections are shown, allows users to gracefully exit the quiz upon completion. This smart flow ensures users are guided smoothly through learning, correction, and closure phases, making SmartQuizApp a valuable tool for students and enthusiasts aiming to test and improve their historical knowledge in a simple, mobile-friendly way.
